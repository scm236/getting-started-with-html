    <b>Web basics</b>
<br>You (and your browser) request to the Internet, which requests to servers (closet computers hosting files)<br>

HTML: “HyperText Markup Language” – base for all web pages
<br>Made up of: text content (what you see), markup (what it looks like)<br>Can contain references to other documents (images/videos/etc), links to other pages
<br><br>

<b>HTML tags</b> - in all cases, replace parentheses with greater/less than signs to make functional<br>
Bold (b)bold(/b)<br>
Emphasis (em)italicize(/em)<br>
Image tag: (img): (img src=”url” alt=”text”) [nice to include alt just in case url doesn’t work][“void” tag doesn’t need a closing tag]<br>
Break tag (br) makes a line break [another void tag], stack if you want multiple breaks <br>
Paragraph tag (p) content (/p) will render as a paragraph<br>
Difference between break and paragraph tags: former is inline (just text), whereas paragraph makes a block (with height and width)<br>
Span and div both contain content (inline and block, respectively): (span) text (/span), (div) text (/div)<br>
<br>
<b>Attributes</b>: (tag ATTR=“value”)contents(/tag)<br>
Anchors make links (a href = www.reddit.com)derp(/a) links to Reddit and displays “derp”<br>
